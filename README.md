# CSC340Project

For this project, we are attempting to create our own style of a text adventure.
At this point in the development process, we are still unsure how everything will come together.

###The Team

**Daniel Hill** - Engine Programmer <br />
**Josh "Queen" Queen** - Storywriter <br />
**Cameron Myers** - Code Maintenance

*Note from Daniel* - All of us have taken on the role of game logic programmers because it is important
that we each develop a total understanding of how the game will be executed.

###To-Do

1. ~~Program the first iteration (rough draft) of the engine~~
2. ~~Write the story for the game~~
3. ~~Complete use-case diagrams and scenarios for the gameplay element~~
4. Discuss and design overall gameplay logic
5. Implement gameplay logic designs

*Most likely more to-dos to come!*
